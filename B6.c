 Purpose: This program does the following:
 a) Creates a Single Link with each node having values that defines a polynomial:
 --- the coefficient
 --- the power
 --- pointer to next such 'poynomial' node
 b) Ensures that Single Linked List is ordered in Descending Value of the polynomial power value. This means:
 --- 'head' node always has the term with the HIGHEST value of power
 --- tail or last node always has the term with the LOWEST value of power
 --- It is allowed to have duplicate terms for the power value. This just means that there will be many nodes with the same values. E.g multiple 3x^4 (OR) 6x^4 and 5x^4
 c) Terminates the polynomial entry / creation when the user enters '0' for the value of BOTH power and coefficient
 NOTE: You can always enter EITHER Coefficient OR Power to be zero to accomodate cases such as
---- 0x^3 where the coefficient of x^3 is zero
---- 4x^0 where the power of coeffcient 4 is zero meaning 4 will be multiplied by 1(that is 4x1)
 d) Evaluates the value of the polynomial where the value of the term 'x' is entered
 e) Assumptions:
 --- It is assumed that the polynomial will add up the terms
 --- If subtraction needs to be done negative coefficients need to be entered
 --- it is assumed that the coefficient and powers are numbers and not alphabets or special characters
 --- When the coefficient value is entered as zero, it is assumed that the data entry for polynomial creation is done. The power value is not considered in this case.
